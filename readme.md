## How to Play
When you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard it's going to play the corresponding sound that is associated with the key.

## Timeframe

2 hours on week 6 of part-time course at GA.

## Goals
* Assign variables.
* Creation and calling of functions.
* Use of if else if Statements.
* Use of Comparison Operators such as === and !== .
* Adding event listeners.
* Use of classList.add and classList.remove

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Java Script


## Approach 

The below is a comment-driven development:

* Add event listener (keydown) to window element.
* Create function 'play sound'
 * Variables: key & sound
 * If else if Statements to validate (event.keyCode) and assign audio and div.
 * Add the "playing" class to the div and remove it after some time.
* Play the sound
